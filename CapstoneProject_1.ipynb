It is also one of the world's top ten centres of commerce in terms of global financial flow. The city houses important financial institutions and the corporate headquarters of numerous Indian companies and multinational corporations. It is also home to some of India's premier scientific and nuclear institutes. As a resident of this city, I decided to use Mumbai in my project. The city is divided into __8 regions__ in total (i.e. Central Mumbai, Thane District, Eastern Mumbai, Western Mumbai, South West Mumbai, South Mumbai, Harbour Lines, Navi Mumbai).\n\nBeing the center of Multiple institutions and companies, it is sometime required for people to move to Mumbai for personal and professional growth. People coming to this city are from different backgrounds, some have money to spend and some are coming to earn some money. Hence while searching for rented flats, they need to consider their financial capabilities, family size (if moving with family) and location of their work. After all these consideration, they can choose the area in their interested location and type of flats they wanted to stay.\n\nIn this project, we consider all these problems and we will try to find an optimal location and area to stay. We will create maps and information charts for different locations of Mumbai and each locations is clustered according to the venue categories. Advantages of each area will then be clearly expressed so that best possible final location can be chosen by stakeholders."
